## Key Features
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automated pipelines for seamless code integration and deployment.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage infrastructure through code with Terraform for consistency and scalability.
- Configuration Management: Utilize Ansible for automated configuration of servers and applications.
- Containerization: Leverage Docker to create lightweight, portable containers for applications.
- Orchestration: Use Kubernetes for managing containerized applications across a cluster of machines.

## My Contribution
In this project, I contributed to designing and implementing the CI/CD pipeline, integrating various DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. I focused on automating deployment processes and ensuring the reliability of web applications through continuous testing and monitoring. Additionally, I assisted in setting up infrastructure using Terraform and managed configurations with Ansible, leading to a more streamlined development workflow.
